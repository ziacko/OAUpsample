= Workflow to make your first Pull Request
Assuming that you already have an Eclipse User account and signed the Eclipse Contribution Agreement, the following is how you can create PR's for MicroProfile related project:

* If it's the first time you are going to work on a repository: Fork into your github account.
* Download (you can use the Github UI option `Open With Github Desktop`) your new fork into your computer.
* In your local repository, create a branch for the contribution, example:

  git checkout -b microProfilePatch

* Set your upstream to your origin:

  git push --set-upstream origin microProfilePatch

* Add, edit or perform the changes required in your contribution.
* Stage your new files:

  git add .

* Assuming your GitHub username is: `CONTRIBUTOR` and the email address used for your Eclipse account is: `CONTRIBUTOR@mail.com`, the following is the line you can use to commit and sign your contribution. Before you do so, verify that you have configured Git with the correct email using `git config --get user.email`

  git commit -m "Added my contribution" -s

[NOTE]
====
If your Eclipse account was configure using a different email address than the one you normally use in your local git `user.email` configuration, you have a couple of options to modify your `email` in your contribution:

1. You can configure the specific email address in your `.git/config` for a specific repository. From within the repository execute:

  git config user.email "NEWEMAIL@mail.com"

2. Or, Amend the commit with the specific email address:

  git commit --amend --author="CONTRIBUTOR <NEWEMAIL@mail.com>"

====

* Push your changes to your remote repository

  git push

* Navigating to Github web UI, create the Pull request.
